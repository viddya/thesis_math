   thesis_appendix2.tex - Example appendix
   thesis_ch1.tex - Example chapter
   thesis_ch2.tex - Example chapter
   thesis_dedication.tex - Example dedication
   thesis_thanks.tex - Example acknowledgements
   thesis.bib - Bibliography file
   thesis2.cls - The thesis style (class) file; put it in the same directory

   thesis.tex - THIS FILE IS THE DRIVER.

As of about January 2003, the Thesis Guidelines document was
retired and is no longer binding. Instead, these templates and
style files have been approved by the CU-Denver Graduate School
meet all thesis formatting requirements. ALL CU-DENVER MATHEMATICS
THESIS MUST BE WRITTEN WITH THESE FILES.

Some of the files are filled with example (nonsense) text so that
you can see various features of LaTeX exercised (for example,
figures, tables, theorems, proofs. Some of the files are optional.

There are two choices for a bibliography, as explained in most
LaTeX reference books. (1) You can create a master file called
thesis.bib (template included in this collection of files) and use
the \bibliography{thesis} command. The advantage is that
thesis.bib can be used for other papers. (2) You can create the
file thesis_bib.tex which is a list of references written
specifically for this thesis.
